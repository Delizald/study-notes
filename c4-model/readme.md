**C4 Model**

The c4 models consists of a hierachical set of software architecture diagrams for **context**, **containers**, **components** and **code**.

The C4 model considers the static structures of a  **software system**  in terms of  **containers**  (applications, data stores, microservices, etc.),  **components**, and  **code**. It also considers the  **people**  who use the software systems that we build.

**Context**:  Shows  how the system fits into the world in terms of users and other software it interacts with.

**Container**:  Zooms into a system and shows the containers (apps, data stores, microservicces) that compose it.

**Component**: Zooms into a container to show the components inside it. (In the C4 model, components are not separately deployable units.)

**Code**: Shows how a component is implemented (like a UML class diagram)
